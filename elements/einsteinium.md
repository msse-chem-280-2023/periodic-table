Einsteinium is a soft, paramagnetic metal. Einsteinium was discovered as part of the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952. Isotopes of einsteinium are very radioactive and are considered highly dangerous.
The radioactivity of einsteinium has a potential use in radiation therapy, and organometallic complexes have been synthesized.
