Ruthenium is a rare transition metal, belonging to the platinum group of the periodic table.

It was first discovered in 1844 by Karl Ernst Claus at Kazan State University and was named in honor of Russia.

One of its major applications is as a chemical catalyst. The Grubbs' catalyst, along with its many derivatives, involve a ruthenium-coordination complex that facilitates olefin metathesis.
