Selenium is involved in redox reactions within living organisms and plays a vital role in certain enzymes called selenoproteins. These selenoproteins are essential for various biological processes, including thyroid hormone metabolism, immune function, and the defense against oxidative stress.
One of the most well-known selenoproteins is the enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which helps protect cells from oxidative damage by catalyzing the breakdown of harmful hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxides. Additionally, selenoproteins are crucial for proper functioning of the thyroid gland and are essential for the synthesis and activation of thyroid hormones, which play a critical role in regulating metabolism.

In its amorphous form, selenium exhibits photoconductivity, meaning it can convert light directly into electricity. This property led to the early development of photoelectric cells and laid the foundation for modern solar cell technology
